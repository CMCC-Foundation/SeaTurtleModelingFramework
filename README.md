# SeaTurtleModelingFramework

## Description

This project focuses on modeling Mediterranean sea turtles using satellite tracking, environmental variables, and machine learning techniques. The goal is to understand the movement patterns and habitat selection of loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta) in the Mediterranean Sea to support conservation and ecosystem management efforts.

## Data

The input data for this project is organized as follows:

- `input` folder: Contains two subfolders:
  - `presence`: Contains Excel files with the presence data of loggerhead sea turtles, including corresponding features.
  - `absence`: Contains Excel files with the absence data of loggerhead sea turtles, including corresponding features.
